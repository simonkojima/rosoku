def normalize(X_train, X_valid, X_test, return_params=False):
    """
    Z-score normalization across channels for EEG-style tensors.

    Normalization parameters (mean, std) are computed only from ``X_train``
    and applied to validation and test data. This ensures no data leakage
    during evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_train : np.ndarray
        Training data with shape ``(n_trials, n_channels, n_times)``.
        Used to compute the normalization mean and std.

    X_valid : np.ndarray
        Validation data with shape ``(n_trials, n_channels, n_times)``.

    X_test : np.ndarray or list of np.ndarray
        Test data with shape ``(n_trials, n_channels, n_times)``
        or a list of such arrays (e.g., multiple test groups).

    return_params : bool, default=False
        If ``True``, also return the computed ``mean`` and ``std`` arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    X_train_norm : np.ndarray
        Normalized training data with same shape as ``X_train``.
    X_valid_norm : np.ndarray
        Normalized validation data.
    X_test_norm : np.ndarray or list of np.ndarray
        Normalized test data. The output type matches the input type
        (single ndarray or list of ndarrays).
    mean : np.ndarray, optional
        Mean used for normalization. Returned only when
        ``return_params=True``.
    std : np.ndarray, optional
        Standard deviation used for normalization. Returned only when
        ``return_params=True``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Input tensors must follow shape ``(n_trials, n_channels, n_times)``.
    - Mean and std are computed per-channel across all trials and time samples.
    - ``mean``/``std`` are reshaped to ``(1, n_channels, 1)``
      for broadcasting during normalization.
    - Test sets do **not** influence normalization statistics.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X_train_norm, X_valid_norm, X_test_norm = normalize(X_train, X_valid, X_test)
    >>> X_train_norm, X_valid_norm, X_test_norm, mean, std = \
    ...     normalize(X_train, X_valid, X_test, return_params=True)
